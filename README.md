The project is maintained by a non-profit organisation called the **Ghost Foundation**, along with an amazing group of independent [contributors](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-Desktop/contributors). We're trying to make publishing software that changes the shape of online journalism.

# Ghost Desktop
Ghost Desktop is currently in development - we're building a beautiful desktop application that allows you to easily manage multiple Ghost blogs and work without distractions. If you're interested in giving us a hand, [check out the contributing guide](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-Desktop/tree/master/docs)!

## Download the Development Build
While Ghost Desktop is not yet ready for consumers, we would love to get some feedback and help from the developer community. The development build resembles closely what [will be the first public release](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-Desktop/milestones/0.1.0), but we want to make sure that we got as many :eyes: as possible on the app before we actually release it. **[Go ahead, download the dev build now](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-Desktop/releases) - and [report issues](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-Desktop/issues) wherever you see them!
